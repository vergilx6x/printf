## Description
This groub project is part ALX SE program.
making a copy of c printf function .

What you should learn from this project:

* How to Collaborating on GitHub
* what is printf
* Applying variadic functions to a big project
* Managing files and finding a good workflow sd a team

---

## Prototype
```int _printf(const char *format, ...);```

## Usage
* Prints a string to the standard output, according to a given format
* All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS using GCC 4.8.4 with the command ```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c```
* Call it this way: ```_printf("format string", arguments...)``` where ```format string``` can contain conversion specifiers along with regular characters.

## Examples

* ```_printf("%s", "Hello world")``` *prints "Hello world"*
* ```_printf("Hello, main\n")``` *prints "Hello, Main", followed by a new line*
* ```_printf("This is a number: %d", 112)``` *prints "This is a number: 112"*

# Tasks

These are all the tasks of this project, the ones that are completed link to the corresponding files.

### [0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life](./functions.c)
* Write a function that produces output according to format.
  - c : converts input into a character
  - s : converts input into a string

### [1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't](handle_print.c)
* Handle the following conversion specifiers:
